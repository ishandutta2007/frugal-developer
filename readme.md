## frugal-developer
List of free services for developers like database, hosting, authentication and other stuff.  
Check it out at [frugal-developer.netlify.app](https://frugal-developer.netlify.app). 

I had many tools in my private repository and thought why not bring it to the public?
Inspired by [other awesome list sites](https://frugal-developer.netlify.app/tags/awesome-list/), surprisingly there are not many alternatives out there that focusing on free programming tools, so I created my own dev-tool list to start prototyping or making an MVP.


Built with Hugo Static site generator and hosted at Netlify.

## Rules
1. Only accept free stuff or free trial at least 1 Year.
2. What is not suitable on this site:   
   - We're not accepting language/framework specific tools. 
   - Link to "part of specific tools" for example "themes for hugo"
   - Library for a certain framework/language, (e.g. Javascript library). 
   - Link to Documentation or Forum of a certain tool

They're great but there are more suitable place for those tools. 

## Contribute
Want to add new stuff?   
1a. Use this form
[Form New Stuff+](https://frugal-developer.netlify.app/new-stuff)  
it will prefill some value for your github Pull Request

1b. If you're going to create file manually (not via link above):

a. Fork repo  
b. Inside your fork navigate to `content/stuff`

P.S:

- You can use any image for thumbnail, but try to avoid using small favicons(16x16) as each **image will be resized to 80x80**
- For existing tags visit https://frugal-developer.netlify.app/ and open the "Filter"
- At the end write the features as one feature per line
